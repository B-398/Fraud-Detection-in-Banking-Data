1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Credit Data

3. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Dropping unwanted column
4. Data Normalization
5. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
6. Feature Extraction and Feature Selection 
7. Splitting the Dataset
8. Building the Model

9. Training and Building the model
10. Dumping the model


Flask Framework
----------------

 
11. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
12. Importing the packages
13. User gives input as Feature Values 
14. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
15. Trained model is used for prediction
16. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

 
Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use CreditCArd Fraud Dataset for analysis with different oversampling method using LightGBM model and compared with
XGBoost model, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier which got 100% of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
